Please create a new web application using Vue.js as the frontend technology stack. Use the following specifications:

1. **Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API
2. **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
3. **Package Manager**: Use npm or yarn for dependency management
4. **Project Structure**: Initialize the project using Vue CLI or create-vue for proper scaffolding
5. **Styling**: Include a CSS framework (such as Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or Vuetify) for responsive design
6. **State Management**: Set up Pinia for state management if the application requires complex state handling
7. **Routing**: Configure Vue Router for single-page application navigation
8. **Development Environment**: Ensure hot reload is properly configured for real-time development feedback

Please initialize the project in the current workspace directory and set up a basic application structure with at least one example component and route. After setup, provide instructions on how to run the development server and verify the application is working correctly.
